Repository to the laboratory of the discipline of Operational Systems 2019.1

	Instructions for compiling the algorithms:
			1 - You must have installed one of the latest packages of g ++ (I'm using version 8.3);
			2 - Open the terminal in the folder where the program file is located;

		For the banker's algorithms;
			3 - Type g++ <filename> -o <filename>
				3.1 - After that type ./ <output_file_name>
				3.2 - Example:
						~ $ g++ banker_algorithm.cpp -o outFile
						~ $ ./outFile
		For the Barber Algorithm:
			4 - Type g++ <filename> -pthread -o <filename>
				4.1 - After that type ./ <output_file_name>
				4.2 - Example:
						~ $ g++ barber_algorithm.cpp -pthread -o outFile
						~ $ ./outFile
